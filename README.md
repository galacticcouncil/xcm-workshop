# XCM Workshop

> Yet another workshop

XCM workshop to demonstrate and explain XCM token transfers from the local parachain setup, through asset configuration and 
transfers.

Note: 

Uses docsify to generate static page. 

https://docsify.js.org/#/

Chosen because it does not generate static html files. It simply generates website on the fly from the markdown files.

Eg, run with python:
```
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

or by any other means which can serve html content.
